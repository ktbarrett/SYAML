# `scdil` - Simple Configuration and Data Interchange Language

A simple data interchange language that is effective at both human-to-program and program-to-program data interchange.
It is simpler than YAML, and more readible and writable than JSON. scdil is a superset of JSON.

This repo contains the [scdil specification document](spec.md) as well as a reference implementation in Python.
